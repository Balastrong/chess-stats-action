## Usage

Add these two placeholders somewhere in your `README.md`, they will get replaced by the action.

```html
<!--START_SECTION:chessStats-->

<!--END_SECTION:chessStats-->
```

Create a GitHub Action in your repository, you can call it `chess-stats-action.yml`.

```yaml
name: Chess Stats Action

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme:

      - uses: Balastrong/chess-stats-action@main
        with:
          CHESS_USERNAME: <Your chess.com Username>
